Description: Built off of Jeremy Sheaffer's code from assignment 1.06. This assignment was to read in a file called ""monster_desc.txt" and parse the information of each
	     monster. Then print the monster out if it met the critera of defining all required keywords, otherwise the monster will be discarded. My program meets all requirements
	     of parsing the file(located under HOME in .rlg327/) and then printing out the monster if it met the critera. I was able to complete this by parsing the information of 
	     each monster into their own monster objects which I would print with a method called printMonster if the monster met all critera. I did not do the option part of this 
	     assignment which was to parse the information from the "object_desc.txt" file.
