Description: Built off of Jeremy Sheaffer's code from assignment 1.04. This assignment required us to implement an user interface with Ncurses. I have fully implemented all
	     required functionality for the assignment. The player can be controlled by the user, using the correct commands from the 
	     instructions. Stairs are generated in the upper left hand corner of rooms 0 and 1. When a player is ontop of one of these stairs,
	     the user must input the command corresponding to the stair(ex: '>' enter '>', vise versa). Once the correct command is inputted
	     the player will go up or down the stairs and a new dungeon will be generated with new monsters. The user can also pull up a list of
	     the monsters which will show the monsters characters along with the direction with units from the player(North, South, East, West).
	     Scrolling functionality is also implemented with the monster's list.
