Description: Built off of Jeremy Sheaffer's code from assignment 1.09. For this assignment we were able to add in our own functionality into the dungeon game. Added functionality for the player to know the remaining health of a monster it is currelty combating.
	     The remaining health is displayed at the top along with the monster name and damage done. I then implemented a new terrian for Lava with a red "%". This lava terrian randomly generates throughout the dungeon and kills the player instantly if touched.
	     Added the functionality of displaying the player health near the lower right corner. The Health displays in the following color schemes: GREEN = Health >= 75%, Orangeish/Yellow = Health 50%-75%, RED= Health below 50%.The health will regerate slowly 
	     when the player decides to idle for a turn since in most game I have played, health doesn't regenerate unitl the player is standing still. Also added safezone/healthspots around the map that when the pc is ontop of one of these safezones, the PC health
	     is regenerated to 100% instantly and as long as they stay on top of this safezone, their health will continue to regen to 100%.
