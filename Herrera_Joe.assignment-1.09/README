Description: Built off of Jeremy Sheaffer's code from assignment 1.08. For this assignment we had to make it possible to pick up
	     equipment from the dungeon floor and equip/use it. We also had to update the combat system so that the player and 
	     monsters to now do damaged based on their damage dice roll. I implemented the functionality of the equipment/objects on
	     the floor to dissapear only when the player goes over it. I didn't get to implement the functionality of these objects.
	     I also updated the combat in the game to be based on the damage roll and updated the movement of the monsters so when 
	     a monster tries to move into a space that is occupied by another monster, it will find a surround open cell to move to, if
	     there is no other open cell then the monster swaps positions with the other monster. The game also ends only when a monster
	     with the tag of a BOSS is killed by the PC. Monsters cannot harm other monsters. I also added a feature when the player does
	     damage to a monster, it will show at the top of the dungeon how much remaining health this monster has.
